# Memory: WSL port stability & server control
# - Avoid starting/stopping the Next.js dev server on port 4000 with ad-hoc commands.
# - Always use ./blueforce-start.sh (start/stop/restart/status) to control the UI server.
# - WSL can leave ports in unstable states after rapid restarts; check with `./blueforce-start.sh status` first.
# - Standard ports: UI 4000, Ollama 11434. Avoid 3000â€“3023 to prevent conflicts with reserved services.

# Memory: PR workflow & release practice
# - Use short-lived feature branches for work. Open PRs to main early.
# - On push: wait for CI lint/build to pass (green checks) before merging.
# - Preferred merge strategy: Squash & merge, then delete the source branch.
# - Keep PRs focused and small; include brief description and screenshots/GIFs when UI changes.
