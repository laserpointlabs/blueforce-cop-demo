## What We Need to Validate With You

## What We Need to Validate With You

### 1. Demo Scenario Realism
**Is our 35-minute demo scenario realistic for your environment?**
- Are Link-16 and VMF the right standards to showcase?
- Is 95% rules coverage a meaningful target?
- Does the PM dashboard show the KPIs you actually care about?

### 2. Success Metrics That Matter
**The storyboard defines technical metrics - what business metrics matter?**
- We plan to show "dramatic reduction in integration timelines" - what's your baseline?
- Beyond compliance, what makes a COP integration "successful" to operators?
- What would convince leadership this tool provides ROI?

### 3. Failure Scenarios & Risk Tolerance
**How should we handle things going wrong in the demo?**
- If automated extraction only gets 85% coverage, is that acceptable?
- When AI personas disagree on mappings, who decides?
- What level of human oversight feels right vs. too much automation?

### 4. Operator Experience Priorities
**What matters most to the people using the COP?**
- Is MIL-STD-2525 symbology the right visualization standard?
- How important is real-time data vs. historical replay?
- What data layers do operators toggle most often?

### 5. Next Standards After VMF/Link-16
**What's your roadmap beyond the demo?**
- Which standards would you add 3rd, 4th, 5th?
- Are there legacy standards that need special handling?
- Any standards that typically conflict with each other?

## Storyboard Assumptions to Confirm

### Technical Assumptions
- **AI Personas:** Standards Analyst, Data Pipeline Engineer, Data Modeler, UI/UX Prototyper work autonomously
- **Output:** Compliance dashboard, lineage panel, validation results, artifact downloads
- **Timeline:** 3-12 min for extraction, 12-20 min for pipeline gen, 20-27 min for visualization

**Question:** Do these personas and timelines match how you think about the work?

### Business Assumptions  
- **PM Role:** Reviews dashboard, provides feedback, approves iterations
- **Value Prop:** Faster integration + improved compliance + enhanced traceability
- **Scope:** Unclassified/mock data sources with audit logging

**Question:** Is this the right level of PM involvement and business value?

---

## Key Gaps Not Covered in Storyboard

### 1. **Integration with Existing Systems**
- How does this connect to your current COP infrastructure?
- What data formats do you actually receive (files, streams, APIs)?
- Any existing tools this needs to work alongside?

### 2. **Organizational Change Management**
- Who needs training on this tool?
- How do we get operator buy-in for automated integrations?
- What approval processes exist for new tools?

### 3. **Production Readiness**
- What security/compliance requirements beyond audit logging?
- Performance requirements for real operational data volumes?
- Disaster recovery and fallback procedures?

- Show multiple standards being added rapidly
- Emphasize automation reducing manual work

**Option B: Quality Focus**  
- Deep dive on validation and compliance checking
- Show how conflicts are detected and resolved
- Emphasize accuracy and traceability

**Option C: Operator Focus**
- Spend more time on COP visualization
- Show different data layers and symbology
- Emphasize usability and trust-building

**Question:** Which resonates most with your stakeholders?

## Critical Questions for Today's Discussion

### **Current State Reality Check**
1. **"What's your actual timeline for integrating a new standard like VMF today?"**
2. **"Who are the 3-5 people who would use this tool, and what are their biggest frustrations?"**

### **Demo Validation**
3. **"If we show 95% rule coverage in 35 minutes, would that feel realistic or too good to be true?"**
4. **"What would you want to see go wrong in the demo to make it feel authentic?"**

### **Business Case**
5. **"Beyond faster integration, what business problem does this solve for your organization?"**
6. **"What would leadership need to see to approve this for production use?"**

### **Operational Reality**
7. **"How do operators currently know when to trust data from different sources?"**
8. **"What happens when automated systems make mistakes in your environment?"**

## Appendix: Heilmeier Catechism

*The following are our initial answers to the Heilmeier questions - we'll refine these based on stakeholder input.*

### 1. What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.

We want to let military program managers upload technical documents for data standards (like Link-16 or VMF) and automatically get a working tactical display that can show data from all those different sources in one unified view. Instead of taking weeks or months to integrate new data sources, it should take hours.

### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?

Today, integrating a new military data standard into a Common Operating Picture requires:
- Manual analysis of 100+ page specification documents
- Hand-coding data parsers and validators  
- Custom mapping between different data formats
- Manual testing and debugging of integrations
- Weeks to months of developer time per standard

**Limits:** Slow, error-prone, requires specialized expertise, doesn't scale as more standards are added.

### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?

We use AI agents (personas) that specialize in different aspects of integration:
- One agent reads and understands specification documents
- Another generates the code to parse and validate data
- Another creates the visual displays and mappings
- They work together with full audit trails

**Why it will work:** AI can read technical documents faster than humans, generate code more consistently, and work in parallel rather than sequentially.

### 4. Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?

**Who:** Military program managers, defense contractors, system integrators, tactical operators

**Difference:** 
- Faster response to new mission requirements (hours vs. weeks)
- More reliable data integration with fewer bugs
- Ability to rapidly prototype with multiple data sources
- Reduced dependency on scarce integration specialists
- Better interoperability between different military systems

### 5. What are the risks?

**Technical Risks:**
- AI misinterprets specification documents (mitigation: human review + validation testing)
- Generated code has bugs or security vulnerabilities (mitigation: automated testing + code review)
- Integration doesn't scale to real-world data volumes (mitigation: performance testing)

**Operational Risks:**
- Users don't trust automatically generated integrations (mitigation: transparency + audit trails)
- Tool becomes a single point of failure (mitigation: fallback to manual processes)
- AI training data becomes outdated (mitigation: continuous model updates)

**Business Risks:**
- Market adoption slower than expected (mitigation: focus on clear ROI metrics)
- Competitors develop similar solutions (mitigation: focus on user experience + domain expertise)

### 6. How much will it cost?

**Development Phase (6-12 months):**
- Engineering team: $500K - $1M
- AI/ML infrastructure: $100K - $200K
- Testing and validation: $200K - $400K
- **Total Development:** $800K - $1.6M

**Operational Phase (per year):**
- Cloud infrastructure: $50K - $100K
- Model training/updates: $100K - $200K
- Support and maintenance: $200K - $400K
- **Total Annual Operating:** $350K - $700K

### 7. How long will it take?

**Phase 1 - MVP Demo (3 months):** Working prototype with Link-16 and VMF
**Phase 2 - Alpha Release (6 months):** Production-ready with 3-5 standards
**Phase 3 - Beta Program (9 months):** Pilot with 2-3 customer organizations
**Phase 4 - General Release (12 months):** Full product launch

**Key Milestones:**
- Month 1: Deterministic extraction working
- Month 3: End-to-end demo with 2 standards
- Month 6: Production deployment at first customer
- Month 12: Supporting 10+ military data standards

### 8. What are the mid-term and final "exams" to check for success?

**Mid-term Exams (3-6 months):**
- [ ] Successfully integrate 2 new standards in under 4 hours each
- [ ] Generate validation code with >95% rule coverage
- [ ] PM can review and approve integration without technical expertise
