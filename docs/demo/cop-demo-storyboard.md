## Original Storyboard (verbatim)

I told you I was going to put together an outline for our hypothetical demonstration of the Blue Force COP. So, here's my idea for the 'storyboard outline' of this demonstration. I hope this helps...

1. Program Manager’s Challenge
A Program Manager (PM) responsible for developing and evolving a Common Operating Picture (COP) tool faces the need to rapidly integrate new data standards (e.g., Link-16, VMF) to support evolving mission requirements and interoperability demands.
2. Launching the Agentic AI Application
The PM accesses the Agentic AI application, designed to augment the development workflow by automating the ingestion and integration of new data sources into the COP platform.
3. Persona Generation and Task Delegation
The AI autonomously creates specialized virtual personas:
• Standards Analyst: Parses and interprets Link-16 and VMF documentation.
• Data Pipeline Engineer: Designs and configures ingestion and transformation workflows.
• Data Modeler: Aligns and harmonizes disparate data models.
• UI/UX Prototyper: Prepares visualization components for the COP.
Each persona is assigned a role, working in concert to accelerate the integration process.
4. Automated Standards Ingestion
The Standards Analyst persona ingests and analyzes the technical documentation for Link-16 and VMF, extracting schemas, field definitions, and compliance rules.
5. Pipeline and Mapping Generation
The Data Pipeline Engineer persona, leveraging the extracted standards, auto-generates code and configuration for parsing, validating, and normalizing incoming data streams.
The Data Modeler persona maps the normalized data into the COP’s unified schema, resolving field mismatches and ensuring interoperability.
6. Rapid Visualization Prototyping
The UI/UX Prototyper persona configures a prototype visualization layer, integrating the new data feeds into the COP interface, and highlights compliance status and data lineage for traceability.
7. Automated Orchestration and Testing
The Agentic AI application orchestrates the deployment of data pipelines and visualization components in a sandbox environment. It runs automated tests to validate data integrity, standards compliance, and user experience.
8. Program Manager Oversight and Iteration
The PM reviews the prototype COP, assesses integration fidelity, and provides feedback (e.g., requests for additional data overlays, compliance reporting, or performance metrics). The AI personas iterate on the solution in response.
9. Accelerated Delivery and Documentation
The AI generates technical documentation and integration artifacts, supporting rapid transition from prototype to production and simplifying future onboarding of additional data standards.
10. Outcome: Enhanced Agility and Efficiency
The PM observes a dramatic reduction in integration timelines, improved standards compliance, and enhanced traceability—demonstrating how Agentic AI empowers COP development teams to adapt rapidly to new requirements and deliver mission-critical capabilities faster.
Key Value Proposition:
This storyboard highlights how Agentic AI transforms the COP development lifecycle—automating standards ingestion, accelerating prototyping, and enabling rapid, standards-compliant integration of new data sources, all under the program manager’s strategic direction.
I hope the above makes sense.

## Expanded Storyboard (stakeholder-aligned)

0. Demo Setup and Success Criteria
- Define measurable KPIs: total demo time ≤ 35 min, 0 critical validation errors, ≥ 95% rules coverage, end-to-end latency targets.
- Preflight checks: service health, model availability, environment audit logging enabled.

1. Program Manager’s Challenge (with acceptance criteria)
- Success metrics established and visible on dashboard (time remaining, pass/fail counters).
- Gate points where PM can approve/iterate next phase.

2. Launching the Agentic AI Application (governance)
- Audit trail on persona actions and generated artifacts (prompts/configs stored with hashes and timestamps).
- Security note: sources are unclassified/mock; access scoped, logs retained.

3. Persona Generation and Task Delegation (RACI + KPIs)
- Personas created with explicit roles and KPIs (e.g., extraction coverage, code gen success, mapping conflict resolution rate, UI artifact completeness).
- Hand-offs modeled; each persona publishes artifacts to an index with provenance.

4. Standards Ingestion and Deterministic Ontology Extraction
- Document provenance and versioning captured (Link-16/VMF mock specs, versions, sections).
- Deterministic ontology extraction: produce concepts/relations and compliance rules; compute coverage metric vs. fixtures.
- Stretch preview: probabilistic extraction loop (question-guided passes with confidence and convergence charts).

5. Pipeline and Mapping Generation (validation-first)
- Generate parsing/validation code and transformations; include rules-based validators.
- Run validation suite on mock datasets; expose pass/fail and error classes.
- Version and store generated artifacts (code, configs) with download links.

6. Rapid Visualization Prototyping (operational UX)
- COP visualization prototype with MIL-STD-2525 symbology toggle and data layer controls.
- Compliance dashboard (rule coverage, violations) and data lineage panel (source → schema → model → pipeline → viz).

7. Automated Orchestration and Testing (SRE-friendly)
- Orchestrate deploy of pipelines/viz to sandbox; display health checks and logs.
- Failure-injection demo (e.g., schema mismatch) and recovery/rollback steps.
- Performance snapshot: throughput/latency, resource usage.

8. PM Oversight and Iteration (live KPIs)
- PM dashboard shows progress %, persona statuses, validation results, and artifacts.
- PM provides feedback (e.g., add overlay), triggers quick iteration; changes logged.

9. Accelerated Delivery and Documentation (reproducibility)
- Generate reproducibility bundle (prompts, configs, artifact manifests, compliance report).
- Provide instructions to rerun with a different standard version or additional messages.

10. Outcome and Metrics Recap (value)
- Compare planned vs. actual KPIs; quantify time/quality improvements.
- Highlight extension path: fully probabilistic ontology extraction, additional standards, productionization.

Timing Guide (35 minutes)
- 0–3: Setup, KPIs, preflight
- 3–12: Ingestion + deterministic ontology extraction
- 12–20: Mapping + pipeline gen + validation
- 20–27: Visualization (2525 + lineage + compliance)
- 27–31: Orchestration test + failure-injection + recovery
- 31–35: PM review + metrics recap + stretch preview
